    description: "Bad Apple is a versatile hybrid strain bred by crossing Atomic Apple with Xeno #10. The vibrant lime-colored buds of this high-quality cultivar are covered with burnt-orange hairs and break apart to reveal purple hues hiding under a thick coating of crystals. In addition to being visually appealing, Bad Apple offers cannabis enthusiasts an immaculate terpene profile that, as the name implies, influences a distinctive aroma redolent of sour apples, Flintstones vitamins, sweet vanilla, and gas. This heavy-hitter tastes like watermelon rind on the exhale and instantly encourages a heady stoniness that settles behind the eyes - pairing perfectly with a chill night in. In smaller doses, Bad Apple has been reported to produce a giggly and creative high accompanied by a dose of full-bodied relaxation that develops during longer sessions.",
